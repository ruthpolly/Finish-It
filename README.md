  - Main Area.
  The main home page area consists of instructions and a username entry

- Games page.
  - Finish It! 
  The Games section consists of a main area presenting the phrase to finish, and four options for the user to choose. If the right or wrong answer is selected, the user is presented with the correct answer.
  - At the bottom of the page is a counter to show how many the user has gotten right.

  More categories and animations would be added with more time, and different levels for people to choose from, and perhaps a childrens section with different styling to appeal to younger people.

It is important to make websites as accessible as possible. This was achieved by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes.
