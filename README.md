## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Finish It! Colour Palette]

The website uses pastel colours that are apparent in the hero image and to compliment the colours in other images. The palette was designed by using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for:

- Bruno Ace is used for headings on the site.

- Raleway is used for the text on the site.

### Imagery

The images used were all taken from the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) website.

### Wireframes

The Wireframe was created on [Balsamiq] (<https://balsamiq.com/>).

[Home Page Wireframe]()

[Game Page Wireframe]()

### Features

The website has two pages, a home page and a games page. The game page is reached when a game is started, and a home button is available on the game page.

- Both pages on the website have:

  - A footer which contains social media icon links to instagram, facebook, twitter and youtube.

- Home Page.
  - Main Area.
  The main home page area consists of instructions and a username entry

- Games page.
  - Finish It! Animation.
  The Games section consists of a main area presenting the phrase to finish, and four options for the user to choose. If the right or wrong answer is selected, the user is presented with the correct answer.
  - At the bottom of the page is a counter to show how many the user has gotten right.
  

- Future Implementations.
  - More Games
  More categories and animations would be added with more time, and different levels for people to choose from, and perhaps a childrens section with different styling to appeal to younger people.

### Accessibility

It is important to make websites as accessible as possible. This was achieved by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on links/images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a good colour contrast on the site.
- Making menus accessible by ensuring the current page is marked current for screen readers.

### Full Testing

To fully test my website I used several browsers (google chrome, safari, mozilla firefox) and devices (HP laptop, lenovo monitor, iPad Mini, Iphone 11 and iPhone 13).

I checked each page using google chrome developer tools to make sure they were responsive on different screen sizes.

2. Test every link on the game page. Links all worked as expected and all links leading to an external page opened correctly in a new browser tab.
